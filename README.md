# Assignment1
First assignment in Object orientated programming

I created a HUD/ gui of a fictional Spaceship,  ÍKAROS II.

The display has a 2-D diagram of the spaceship in the top left.

There is a radar which updates when the line reaches the opposite corner to the starting point. I shows the stars and asteroids in the path of ÍKAROS II.

A central circular diagram shows the planets in the local solar system and their relative positions.

The preset menu changes the hardware controlling the speed, but the system is upgrading so the options are not available.

In case of emergency, the user can eject, self destruct or shutdown the terminal. click on the option to the display the name on the video screen.

The sheild menu keeps track of the stability of the amrour to defend against aliens.

3 guages help give a visual representation of the fuel, water, and oxygen levels.
